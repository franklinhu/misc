# Helpful tips
## Navigation
* `ls` lists the files and directories in the current directory
* `ls -l` same as above but with more info
* `pwd` shows the path to the directory you're currently in
* `cd <some-directory>` takes you do that directory
* `cd ~` takes you back to your home directory (~ is shorthand for /home/<user>)
